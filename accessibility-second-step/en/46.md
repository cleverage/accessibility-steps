# Use with caution the onscroll event handler

## Purpose

Avoid users the obligation to have a pointing device such as a mouse and to have the ability to scroll to interact with the site or access an information.

## Technical solution

Do not use the `onscroll` element or provide a way to perform the same action independently of the input device.

## Control method

Scroll the page to see if there are elements triggered on scroll.
