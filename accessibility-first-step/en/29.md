# When you provide a p element, do not leave it empty

## Purpose

Avoid use of elements for presentation use.

## Technical solution

Remove empty `<p>` elements. Use style sheets properties `margin` and `padding` to measure space between elements.

## Control method

Check that content of `<p>` elements is not empty.
